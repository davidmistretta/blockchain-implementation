# blockchain-implementation
where I will be implementing a blockchain

This repository will be used as my independent study of blockchain implementations. I plan on studying blockchain implementations using the following languages: C, GoLang, Python, Java, HTML/CSS/JS. In my study I will narrow down the to efficient languages. 
I am going to be implementing a public blockchain that can support smart contract deployment in an easy manner (hopefully).
This research may or may not be completely open source. 
Cheers to the future and all those who inhabit it!
