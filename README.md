# blockchain-implementation
where I will be implementing a blockchain

This repository will be used as my independent study of blockchain implementations. I plan on studying blockchain implementations using the following languages: C, GoLang, Python, Java, HTML/CSS/JS. In my study I will narrow down the to efficient languages. 
I am going to be implementing a public blockchain that can support smart contract deployment in an easy manner (hopefully).
This research may or may not be completely open source. 
Cheers to the future and all those who inhabit it!

Go programming langauge
Building a blockchain platform is like building an operating system back in the day. It's difficult, complex, and hard to understand. On top of that it's decentralized and distributed. The GO programming language offers many useful traits for building decentralized systems.
1. Maintainable Code in the Long Run
    Because of Go's simplicity, there is less need for more lines of code. This makes the code much easier to maintain and manage as projects progress and works nicely with agile methodologies.
2. Easy for developers to master
    Go is easy to master - it's not that hard. Not much else to say
3. Speed and Efficiency
    Go is a compiled language which reduces overhead time drastically. It is like C in that manner, but a much higher level coding language than C is, and more productive than JavaScript and Python. 
4. It is built for distributed sytems. 
    Go easily scales to millions of requests as compared to PHP
5. Go Routines
    Go has these things called GoRoutines. GoRoutines are methods or functions that run in parallel with other methods or functions. A GoRoutine takes up 4 kilobytes of space in RAM, compared to a thread which takes up 1024 kilobytes in RAM. This makes it possible to run an increasing number of GoRoutines concurrently. 
    "Following is an explanation of handling of threads differ in Go in comparison to Java:

In Java, objects are shared between units of work, and to access this piece of data, a unit of work must first obtain a lock on it. In Go, Channels are shared between units of work, and a channel is basically of a FIFO pipe — a unit of work may read or write to a channel.

Go adheres to its motto of “not to communicate by sharing memory, instead share memory by communicating.”
And, blockchain has a wide importance of parallel actions, where, this particular feature comes very handy. Also, the ability to run a lot of functions in parallel allows programs written in Go to be run on distributed systems — a primary need of the blockchain technology. Some profound examples where Go has been adopted for its concurrency are Docker, MongoDB, Netflix, Uber etc. — companies for whom concurrency and being able to run in a distributed manner is of prime importance." https://medium.com/karachain/why-i-am-building-a-blockchain-in-go-6395a60b24dd

This is just preliminary research of Go technlogy used for Blockchain Platform building.
