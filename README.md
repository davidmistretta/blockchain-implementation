# blockchain-implementation
where I will be implementing a blockchain

This repository will be used as my independent study of blockchain implementations. I plan on studying blockchain implementations using the following languages: C, GoLang, Python, Java, HTML/CSS/JS. In my study I will narrow down the to efficient languages. 
I am going to be implementing a public blockchain that can support smart contract deployment in an easy manner (hopefully).
Cheers to the future!
